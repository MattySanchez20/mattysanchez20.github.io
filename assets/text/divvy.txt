In my analysis of Divvy Bikes rider data, I focused on ride activity over time and customer type. I found that there were clear patterns in the number of rides taken over the course of the week, with peak usage occurring on weekdays and a decline on weekends (due to riders using the bikes for work rather than leisure). Additionally, I looked at the breakdown of rides by customer type, either customer or subscriber, and found that subscribers accounted for the majority of rides taken. This suggests that there is a strong base of loyal customers who use Divvy Bikes regularly throughout the week. Overall, my analysis of the rider data provided valuable insights into the usage patterns of Divvy Bikes and the behaviour of different types of customers.
